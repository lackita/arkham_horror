# Arkham Horror

A Clojure library designed to simulate a game of Arkham Horror.  Currently it supports final fights with Azathoth and Cthulu, although there isn't a UI to provide interactivity on this front.

## Usage

You can start a repl with

	lein repl

and call the available functions.  For now, the only documentation for these methods are in the tests.
